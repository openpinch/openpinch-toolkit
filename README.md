# OPEN PINCH TOOLKIT
Created by Dr Tim Walmsley (openpinch.com, info@openpinch.com)

The toolkit is a simple-to-use Excel Workbook supported by VBA macros. The underpinning code embeds multiple pinch analysis algorithms such as the problem table, multiple utility targeting and total site analysis. Engineers input their process stream data and available utility types, and then select the analysis modules of interest. 

The toolkit includes six distinct modules (see the diagram) from process pinch targets through to automated graphing and total site targets. These modules can support developing energy transition solutions for industrial sites.  

Experienced energy engineers can apply these modules to support numerous types of investigations including
- identification of heat recovery opportunities 
- appropriate placement (source and sink) and sizing of heat pumps including mechanical vapour recompression
- the use of the utility distribution system for side wide heat recovery
